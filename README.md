# HK Bus WayPoints Crawling

![Data fetching status](https://github.com/hkbus/route-waypoints/actions/workflows/crawl.yml/badge.svg) 

This project is to fetch the waypoints from [CSDI](https://portal.csdi.gov.hk/geoportal/#metadataInfoPanel). It is daily synced to the sources and launched in gh-pages.

During the crawling, it will minified the result by truncating to 5 decimal places, (i.e., Â±1m), and minified the json by cleaning useless space characters. Also, as the data is provided statically by `waypoints`, the data transfer supports `Content-Encoding: gzip` for largely preserving your bandwidth.

Links are in format:
- MTR: https://hkbus.github.io/route-waypoints/{LINE_CODE}.json
- LRT: https://hkbus.github.io/route-waypoints/{LINE_NUMBER}-{[O|I]}.json
- Ferry: https://hkbus.github.io/route-waypoints/{ROUTE_ID}.json
- Everything else: https://hkbus.github.io/route-waypoints/{GTFS_ID}-{[O|I]}.json
