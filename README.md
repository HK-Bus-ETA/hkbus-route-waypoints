# HK Bus WayPoints

![Data fetching status](https://github.com/HK-Bus-ETA/hkbus-route-waypoints/actions/workflows/crawl.yml/badge.svg) 

This project is to fetch the waypoints from [CSDI](https://portal.csdi.gov.hk/geoportal/#metadataInfoPanel). It is daily synced to the sources and launched in gh-pages.

During the crawling, it will minified the result by truncating to 5 decimal places, (i.e., Â±1m), and minified the json by cleaning useless space characters. Also, as the data is provided statically by `waypoints`, the data transfer supports `Content-Encoding: gzip` for largely preserving your bandwidth.

Links are in this format:
| Mode | Link |
|---|---|
| MTR | https://waypoints.hkbuseta.com/waypoints/{LINE_CODE}.json |
| LRT | https://waypoints.hkbuseta.com/waypoints/{LINE_NUMBER}-{[O\|I]}.json |
| LRT 705 & 706 | https://waypoints.hkbuseta.com/waypoints/{LINE_NUMBER}.json |
| Ferry | https://waypoints.hkbuseta.com/waypoints/{ROUTE_ID}.json |
| Bus & GMB | https://waypoints.hkbuseta.com/waypoints/{GTFS_ID}-{[O\|I]}.json |
